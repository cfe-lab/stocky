On 2018-09-07, after updating to transcrypt 3.7.4, it seems that importing
the typing module leads to a javascript run-time error, as commands
from the typing module are being imported. This fails at runtime.
The typing calls are actually never called, so can be omitted in the javascript coode.

Demonstrate this problem here.
